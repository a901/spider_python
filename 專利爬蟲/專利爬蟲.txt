For example, a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) can obtain the NIC configuration information from the NIC during the execution of a system check (e.g., Power-On Self-Test). A system controller can receive the NIC configuration information from the BIOS. The system controller can store the NIC configuration information in memory associated with the system controller. A management system can request the NIC configuration information from the system controller using an out-of-band communication channel.

Provided is a system and method to secure a network device such as a server. The network device has a memory storing a static credential file. A basic input output system operates a security module that gathers an IP address of the router and an IP address of the network device, via a query to a network manager when power is enabled to the network device. The gathered IP addresses are compared with stored IP addresses in the static credential file. The operating system of the network device is prevented from booting if the IP addresses do not match. In addition, a baseboard management controller is operable to receive an encrypted credential file. The encrypted credential file is decrypted and compared with the static content file. The baseboard management controller shuts down power to the network device if the credential file does not match the static content file.
