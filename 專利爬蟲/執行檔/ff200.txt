A fan module containing a fan is used to cool a computing device or system. The fan module is mounted within a chassis, and contains a housing, a locking body, and lever. The housing of the fan module contains a housing, a locking body, and lever. The housing of the fan module defines a hollow interior that houses the fan. The locking body is coupled to the housing and is moveable between a locked position. When in the locked position, the locking body extends through a locking aperture in the floor of the chassis. When in the unlocked position, the locking body rises above the locking aperture in the floor of the chassis. Moving the lever from the first position to the second position causes the locking body to move from the locked position to the unlocked position.
