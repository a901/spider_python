Systems and methods are provided for preserving data in memory modules of a computer system. An exemplary method can detect that a software preservation process is needed for a computer system, and thereafter performs the software preservation process. The software preservation process can begin by detecting the initiation of a reduced power mode in a computer system. A syncing process of data contents can then be initiated in a processing unit of the computer system. Next, the computer system can automatically save data contents of a memory module. The software preservation process is completed by turning off a power supply unit of the computer system.
