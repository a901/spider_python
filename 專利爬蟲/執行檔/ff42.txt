A transceiver cage and heat sink assembly for an optical switch is disclosed. A transceiver cage has an open front end to receive an optical transceiver and an opposite rear end. A front heat sink is mounted over the transceiver cage that includes a thermal interface material to contact a contact surface of an optical transceiver. A printed circuit board has a connector electronic circuit to receive a connector on the optical transceiver. A rear heat sink has a beveled surface facing the rear end of the transceiver cage. A cam structure in the front heat sink forces the transceiver into contact with the front heat sink. A metal foil layer is coated on the thermal interface material.
