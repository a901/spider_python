The present disclosure provides a cover configured to fit over computer components in a computer chassis. The cover can have a plurality of doors located over the computer components such that the computer components can be easily inserted or removed from the chassis when a corresponding door is open. The cover can be shaped in a such a way so as to define airflow passages around the computer components. The doors can be configured to pivot open, slide open, or snap into and out of the cover.
