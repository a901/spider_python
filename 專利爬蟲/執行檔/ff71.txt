MECHANISM FOR PREVENTING REFLOW FOR FAN FLAP FAILURE
EP3709782A1 (B1) • 2020-09-16 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2019-03-15 • Earliest publication: 2020-07-11
A fan assembly includes a socket to receive a fan module, a fan flap coupled to a first side wall of the socket, and an anti-reflow device coupled to a second side wall of the socket. The fan flap moves in a curved path between a first position and a second position. The anti-reflow device has an attachment feature, an embossed feature, and a stopping feature. The attachment feature attaches the anti-reflow device to the second side wall. The embossed feature extends through a first aperture in the second side wall. The stopping feature extends through a second aperture in the second side wall and contacts the fan flap. When the fan module is removed, the stopping feature retains the fan flap in the first position to block the socket and prevent air from reflowing through the socket.
