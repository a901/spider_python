Systems and methods are provided for updating expansion read-only memory (ROM) code to execute for device-specific initialization. An exemplary method comprises first accessing one or more copies of a ROM code in at least one of a plurality of repositories. The ROM code can be configured to execute an initialization process for a specific device in the computer system. The method can then select one of the one or more copies of the ROM code based on a selection criterion to yield a selected ROM code. The method can then copy the selected ROM code to a system memory of the computer system. The method can then execute the selected ROM code in the system memory to initialize the specific device.
