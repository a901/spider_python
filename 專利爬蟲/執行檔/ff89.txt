Earliest priority: 2019-03-18 • Earliest publication: 2020-03-03
The present disclosure provides for a computer chassis design, which includes a sled and a sliding bracket. The sliding bracket includes a removable power supplier socket on a first end and a sliding return lever on the second end. When the sled is removed from the computer chassis, the removable power supplier socket can move out of the chassis via a set of mechanisms. The set of mechanisms can include an elastic element to cause the power supplier socket to automatically rotate out of the chassis. The sled can be shaped to extend behind the power supplier socket.
