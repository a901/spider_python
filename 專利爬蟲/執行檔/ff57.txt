This invention discloses a combinatorial mobile hotspot device, a network service provision method thereof, a network access device and a wireless service power supply device. The network access device has a mobile internet access ability to provide an external host machine connecting to a wide area network through the network access device when the network access device is selectively and electrically coupled to the external host machine. A mobile hotspot device is formed while the network access device is electrically coupled to the wireless service power supply device. The wireless service power supply device supplies the power to the network access device. Further, by a wireless local network transceiver, a plurality of electronic devices in the hotspot covering region are able to connect to wide area network through the wireless access point service provided by the network access device.
