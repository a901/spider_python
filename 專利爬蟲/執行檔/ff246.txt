Technologies for remote keyboard-video-mouse sessions can include failover mechanisms. In some embodiments, a system can establish a first remote keyboard-video-mouse session between a console application on the system and a first server application executed by a controller on a server. The first remote keyboard-video-mouse session can be established via a first network connection between the system and the controller. Next, the system can detect an error associated with the first remote keyboard-video-mouse session. In response to the error, the system can establish a second remote keyboard-video-mouse session between the console application and a second server application executed by an operating or a basic input/output program on the server. The second remote keyboard-video-mouse session can be established via a second network connection between the system and the second server application.
