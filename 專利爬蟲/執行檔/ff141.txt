EP3691075A1 (B1) • 2020-08-05 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2019-01-30 • Earliest publication: 2020-04-14
A regulating device (100) includes a common mode choke (102), a switch device (104) and a first control unit (106). The common mode choke includes an input side (102a) and an output side (102b), wherein the input side is coupled to a power-supply device (770). The switch device includes a first input node (104a), a second input node (104b), a first output node (104c), a second output node (104d), and a third output node (104e). The first output node is coupled to a first battery set (BT1), and the second output node is coupled to a second battery set (BT2), and the third output node is an empty node. The first control unit compares the first terminal voltage (V1) to the second terminal voltage (V2) for controlling the first input node to selectively connect to the first output node or the second output node and controlling the second input node to selectively connect to the second output node or the third output node.
