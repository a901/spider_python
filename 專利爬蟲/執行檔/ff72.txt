SYSTEM AND METHOD TO DETECT CAPACITANCE OF A POWER SUPPLY UNIT
EP3462588A1 (B1) • 2019-04-03 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2017-09-27 • Earliest publication: 2019-03-28
A power supply unit that allows measurement of the capacitance without interrupting operation of the unit is disclosed. The unit includes a controller that causes a voltage change of a capacitor from a first threshold voltage between two periods of time. The time difference of when the voltage reaches a second threshold voltage is measured and the capacitance is determined from the time measurement, voltage change and power dissipation. The determination of capacitance may be performed while the power supply unit is actively supplying power.
