In some implementations, service controllers of a computing device are associated with various disparate components of the computing device, and in response to a command issued to any one of the components, the service controllers may communicate with each other in order to transmit data responsive to the command. For example, a computing device may comprise a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a Serial Attached SCSI Expander card (SAS Expander). The BMC of computing device receives a remote command requesting status of a hard drive coupled to the computing device, and the BMC communicates the command to the SAS Expander, for example over a system bus of the computing device. The SAS Expander retrieves a response to the command and communicates the response to the BMC, which then transmits the response to the remote site.
