OUT-OF-BAND CONFIGURATION OF IP ADDRESSES
EP2978194A1 (B1) • 2016-01-27 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2014-07-22 • Earliest publication: 2016-01-27
In some implementations, an IP address can be configured for a computing device using an out-of-band communication channel. For example, a system administrator can configure a system controller (e.g., baseband management controller) with an IP address using an out-of-band communication channel. In some implementations, the system controller can be configured with the IP address when the computing device is powered down. The system controller can store the IP address in memory associated with the system controller. In some implementations, an operating system of the computing device can be configured with an agent (e.g., process, application, utility) that will request the IP address from the system controller and configure the computing device to use the IP address. For example, the operating system agent can use various operating system commands to configure the IP address for the computing device based on the IP address received from the system controller.
