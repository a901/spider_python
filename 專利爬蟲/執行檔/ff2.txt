Various examples of the present technology provide systems and methods for tracking PPR usage in dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) of a server system. BIOS of the server system can check a record of the PPR usage before conducting a PPR flow and sending a usage status of spare row(s) of a plurality of bank groups of a DIMM to a controller (e.g., BMC) of the server system such that a user or the server system can check PPR status of each DIMM of the server system. A determination can be made either automatically by the server system or manually by the user whether or not to replace a corresponding DIMM.
