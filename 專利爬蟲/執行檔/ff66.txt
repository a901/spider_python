Earliest priority: 2018-03-28 • Earliest publication: 2019-09-11
A system and method for efficiently allocating device resources is disclosed. A composer application is executed by a management controller. A fabric box includes fabric switches and a fabric controller. A network is coupled to the management controller and the fabric box. Host servers are each coupled to an upstream port of one of the fabric switches. Multiple device resources are coupled to downstream ports of the fabric switches. The fabric controller determines the path distances between each of the downstream ports and each of the upstream ports. The composer application selects a device based on the shortest path distance to a requested host server in response to an allocation command.
