ELECTRONICS CONNECTOR FOR FACILITATING TREATMENT
EP3624272A1 (B1) • 2020-03-18 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2018-09-14 • Earliest publication: 2020-03-16
In the production of certain components, the components must pass through an existing treating device with limited clearance. This limited clearance will cause unwanted physical contact between the component and the existing treatment apparatus, such as a reflow oven for treating electronic components, such as an M.2 connector. In such a situation, it will be necessary to practice a method of separating the component into subassemblies or modules; separately treating the subassemblies or modules in the reflow oven; and then reassembling the subassemblies and modules after the reflow treatment.
