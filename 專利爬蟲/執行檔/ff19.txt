A method of monitoring I2C bus status using a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a hardware watchdog (HW) circuit is provided. The method includes detecting, using the HW circuit, a failure of an I2C bus and determining if the HW circuit can auto reset I2C devices on the I2C bus. The method also includes, if it is determined that the HW circuit can auto reset the I2C devices on the I2C bus, resetting, using the HW circuit, the I2C devices, and if it is determined that the HW circuit cannot auto reset the I2C devices on the I2C bus, reporting, using the HW circuit, detected failure to the BMC. The method further includes processing, using the BMC, the detected failure.
