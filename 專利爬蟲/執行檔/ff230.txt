An image positioning device is provided in the invention. The image positioning device includes a calculation circuit and a positioning circuit. The calculation circuit obtains a plurality of images from an image capturing device and classifies the images into a plurality of main groups based on a first algorithm, wherein each main group corresponds to a different area and the calculation circuit classifies the images of each main group into a plurality of sub-groups based on a feature of each image of each main group and a clustering algorithm. The positioning circuit is coupled to the calculation circuit. The positioning circuit positions each sub-group in the area corresponding to each main group based on the relative position relationship between each sub-group of each main group.
