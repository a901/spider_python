Various examples of the present disclosure provide a high efficient battery system, and systems and methods for intelligently discharging and charging the battery system such that an output voltage of the battery system is maintained within a predetermined voltage range. In some examples, a base board controller (BMC) is used to manage charging and discharging of the battery system. The BMC can provide both over-charging protection and over-discharging protection for the battery system.
