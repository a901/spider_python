SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REDUCING MANAGEMENT PORTS OF A MULTIPLE NODE CHASSIS SYSTEM
EP3240238A1 (B1) • 2017-11-01 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2016-04-27 • Earliest publication: 2017-07-11
Systems, methods, and computer-readable storage devices for reducing the amount of management ports (and associated cabling) for a top-of-rack server environment are disclosed. Whereas other server management configurations have cabling connecting each node in multiple multi-node chassis in a server rack to a top-of-rack, systems configured as described herein designate a single node as a point of communication for the multi-node chassis. The designated node forwards communications for all nodes in the chassis to a chassis management controller, which acts as a distribution point for all communications within the multi-node chassis, with the benefit of only a single connection being required between the multi-node chassis and the top of rack switch.
