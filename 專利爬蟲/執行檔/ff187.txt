The present technology provides a system and method for smartly resetting a hang device of a server system based upon a Wake-on-Lan (WoL) message and status of the hang device. The system comprises a management device, a switch, a physical layer (PHY) coupled to a network, a network interface (NIC), a monitoring device and a delay circuit. The PHY is coupled to the network to receive network packets that includes a WoL message. The monitoring device is configured to receive status information from the management device and the WoL message, and reset the management device based upon received information.
