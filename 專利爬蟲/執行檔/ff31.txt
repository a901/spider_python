The present disclosure provides a system and method for automatically composing resources in a data center using a management application. The management application can communicate with a data center management software to collect information of computer resource, storage resource, and network resource of the data center. Based at least upon the network resource information of the data center, the management application can generate a network topology of the data center. In response to receiving a request from a specific user, the management application can compose suitable resources of the data center to match the request.
