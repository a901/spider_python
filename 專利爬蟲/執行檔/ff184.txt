Earliest priority: 2019-03-19 • Earliest publication: 2020-09-23
A heat sink having a flexible heat sink base is disclosed in order to flex the heat sink into contact with concave heat sources. Flexibility is achieved by providing a series of concentric grooves on the heat sink base on a surface opposite the surface contacting the heat source. A central cylinder is provided at the center of the concentric grooves. A biasing device, such as a spring, exerts a force on the central cylinder to flex the heat sink base.
