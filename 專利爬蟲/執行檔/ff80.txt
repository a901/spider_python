An anti-acoustics streamline apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes an air impedance wall having a front face, a rear face, and a plurality of openings extending from the front face to the rear face defining open areas; and a plurality of flow separating structures disposed adjacent to the front face, each of the plurality of flow separating structure extending vertically along the front face of the wall. The openings are configured to define first wall regions in the air impedance wall adjacent to each of the plurality of flow separating structures and second wall regions between the first wall regions. A first ratio of the open areas in the first wall regions to a total area in first wall regions is larger than a second ratio of the open areas in the second wall regions to a total area in the second wall regions.
