A service controller (114) of a computing device (102) can store console messages so that an external management device (108) can retrieve the console messages after a malfunction or crash of the computing device. For example, the service controller (114) can be configured to redirect serial output (e.g., console messages, system log messages, system error message, etc.) to a network interface controller (214) for transmission over a network connection. The service controller (114) can be configured to store the console messages in non-volatile memory of the service controller. The service controller (114) can receive a request for the stored console messages and transmit the stored console messages to an external device (108).
