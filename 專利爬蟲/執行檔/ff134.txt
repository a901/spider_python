A service controller (206) on a computing device (202) can be configured to redirect serial output over a network using HTTP. For example, the service controller (206) can be configured with a web server (304) that can receive the serial output and stream the serial output to a web browser (216) over an HTTP connection. In some implementations, the HTTP connection can be a WebSocket connection, as defined by the HTML5 specification. In some implementations, a proxy server (302) can be configured with a web server (304) that can receive serial over LAN (SOL) output from multiple servers and stream the SOL to a web browser (216) on a client device (214).
