This disclosure relates to a Golden Finger card design where the PCB edge has a first thickness, but the main body of the PCB is of increased thickness to accommodate application complexity. The increased thickness in the body portion provides greater dielectric material between traces, thereby reducing loss. By maintaining the edge of the PCB fingers at a first thickness, the use of existing connectors, such as standard PCIe connectors, is maintained. Golden Finger cards of this disclosure are used as a video and graphics card, network adapter card, audio adapter card, and television or other specialty adapter card.
