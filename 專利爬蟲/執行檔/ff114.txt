EP3242217A1 (B1) • 2017-11-08 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2016-05-06 • Earliest publication: 2017-09-11
Various examples of the present technology provide systems and methods for incorporating a switch card and adapter cards in a server system to provide flexible HDD and SSD supports. More specifically, a server system comprises a switch card having at least two different types of interfaces (e.g., a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) interface, a serial ATA (SATA) interface, or a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) interface), and a controller that comprises a first Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a second CPU. The first CPU is connected to a first adapter card while the second CPU is connected to a second adapter card. The first adapter and the second adapter are coupled to the switch card of the server system.
