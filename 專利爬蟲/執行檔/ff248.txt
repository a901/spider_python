DIFFERENT HDD GAP ARCHITECTURE TO REDUCE UPSTREAM PREHEAT FOR HIGH-DENSITY STORAGE
EP3217404A1 (B1) • 2017-09-13 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2016-03-08 • Earliest publication: 2017-09-13
Systems, methods and computer-readable media for reducing upstream preheat for high-density hard disk drive storage. A system can include first and second rows of storage devices installed in a storage rack, the first and second rows having a first distance between consecutive storage devices. The second row can be located behind the first row and farther away from a source of an airflow than the first row. The system can monitor a temperature associated with the second row and when the temperature rises above a threshold, the system can remove a storage device from the first row. The system can then adjust placement within the first row such that the remaining devices have a second, larger distance between each other to increase airflow to storage devices in the second row and reduce system impedance.
