Earliest priority: 2018-01-05 • Earliest publication: 2019-07-10
A dual CMC structure is disclosed for a rack mounted structure. The structure has a first chassis with power supplies, a first chassis management controller, and a first set of network devices. A second chassis includes power supplies, a second chassis management controller and a second set of network devices. The respective chassis management controllers obtain status data of the power supplies, as well as status data from the other chassis management controllers. The first chassis management controller is designated as the master controller and reports the status data from both the first and second chassis. The structure is operable to change communication of the status data to the second chassis management controller, in the event the first chassis management controller fails.
