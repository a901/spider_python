A battery device (100) includes a battery cell (102) and a battery protection circuit (104) The battery protection circuit includes a microcontroller (106) and a power-supply switch (108). The microcontroller (106) receives a start signal (150), a repair signal(152), and an external-power-indication signal (154) from the outside of the battery device. The power-supply switch (108) is electrically connected to the battery cell (102). The microcontroller correspondingly outputs an enable signal (130) to the power-supply switch according to the start signal and the repair signal, so that the power-supply switch disconnects the electrical connection between the battery cell and the battery protection circuit. The microcontroller correspondingly outputs a disable signal (132) to the power-supply switch according to the start signal, the repair signal, and the external-power-indication signal, so that the power-supply switch restores the electrical connection between the battery cell and the battery protection circuit.
