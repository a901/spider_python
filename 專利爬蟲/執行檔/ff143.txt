Embodiments of this disclosure are directed towards a method of logging messages in a baseboard management controller (BMC) system. The method includes powering on a processing chip of the BMC system, wherein the processing chip has a main processor and a co-processor that is communicatively coupled to a non-transitory processor-readable memory device and snooping interface. The method further includes booting up the co-processor, and initiating a storage portion of the non-transitory processor-readable memory device the snooping interface. The method further includes triggering a boot-up of the main processor, and receiving, via the snooping interface, the messages redirected from a communication interface of the BMC system.
