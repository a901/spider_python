A method and structure for improving efficiency of cooling and temperature uniformity among a plurality of heat generating electronic devices arranged in rows within a housing, such as a GPU server, utilizing a single source of cooling air. The electronic devices are arranged in a plurality of rows, but the heat sinks for the last row are elevated above the heat sinks of the first row so as to occupy different positions within the cooling air stream. In some embodiments the heat sinks of the electronic devices are extended forward so as to reside near the heat sinks of the electronic devices in the first row, but in a different flow path of cooling air. In other embodiments, a thermo siphon refrigeration system is provided for the electronic devices in the last row, and may be provided for the electronic devices in the first row as well.
