A power source switching circuit for powering an electronic component includes a soft-start circuit, a first input connected to a standby power source, a second input connected to a main power source, and an output. The output provides a voltage to the electronic component and is configured to be alternatively electrically connected to the first input or the second input. When the power source switching circuit is in a standby mode, the output is connected to the first input and the standby power source. When the power source switching circuit is in a main mode, the output is connected to the second input and the main power source. When the power source switching circuit is initially activated to the standby mode, the soft-start circuit is enabled. When the power source switching circuit subsequently switched from the main mode to the standby mode, the soft-start circuit is disabled.
