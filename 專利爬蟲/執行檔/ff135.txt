A system and method for detecting and compensating for temperature effects in a device having a power supply and a remote node. The system includes a power supply unit having an adjustable voltage output and a feedback circuit. The voltage output is adjusted based on the output of the feedback circuit. A power path is coupled to the power supply unit. The power path has power connectors to supply voltage from the power supply unit to a remote node. The remote node is operable to sense a voltage drop of the power path at the remote node associated with temperature effects on the power connectors. An adjustable resistor has an output coupled to the feedback circuit. A controller is coupled to the remote node and the adjustable resistor. The controller determines a resistance value to compensate for the temperature effects and sets the adjustable resistor to change the power output.
