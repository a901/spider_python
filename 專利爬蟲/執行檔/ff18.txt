This disclosure relates to connecting a metal hose between a radiator and a cold plate that cools a CPU, or similar electronic heat generating component, whereby the metal hose is connected to the radiator with silicon casings. Waterproof spray plates are also provided to direct any water spray away from the electronic components. A water tray beneath the waterproof spray plates collects any water and directs it to a location outside the chassis.
