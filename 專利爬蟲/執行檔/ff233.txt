Earliest priority: 2017-08-09 • Earliest publication: 2019-02-13
Various examples of the present disclosure provide a multi-node fan control switch and systems and methods for controlling one or more cooling fans of a node using a fan control switch and a specific controller (e.g., BMC or a specific processor) of the node. The node also includes a watch dog circuit. The watch dog circuit can monitor health of the specific controller and, in response to determining that the specific controller has failed, enable the fan control switch to an external mode to allow a controller of a neighboring node in the rack system to control the one or more cooling fans of the node.
