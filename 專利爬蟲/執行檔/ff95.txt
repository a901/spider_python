A computing device is provided with a drive slot with a connector for engaging a corresponding connector of a HDD, and a first locking element. The computing device includes a removable a HDD carrier for insertion into the drive slot having a bracket, a handle and an enclosure slidably attached to the bracket for securing the HDD. The handle includes a second locking element extending therefrom and configured to receive the first locking element to restrict the removable HDD carrier to vertical motion. The first locking element engages with the second locking element when the handle is in the loading position and the bracket moves relative to the enclosure to secure the hard disk drive in the bracket and to connect the connector of a hard disk drive to the connector located at the drive slot when the handle transitions from the loading position to the locked position.
