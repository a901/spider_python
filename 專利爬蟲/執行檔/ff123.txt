A battery device with a C-rate of 1C includes a battery cell, a protection chip, and a microcontroller. The protection chip is electrically connected to the battery cell, determines whether to activate the protection mechanism of the battery device according to the state of the battery cell. The microcontroller is electrically connected to the protection chip, detects the RSOC of the battery cell. When an external power supply is electrically coupled to the battery device, and the RSOC of the battery cell is lower than 50%, the microcontroller controls the battery cell to perform a fast charging not over 10 minutes. During the 10 minutes of fast charging, the protection chip activates the protection mechanism, or the microcontroller detects that the battery cell has changed from a CC state to a CV state, the microcontroller stops the fast charging and restores the C-rate of the battery cell to 1C.
