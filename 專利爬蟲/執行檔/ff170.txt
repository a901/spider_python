A system and method for providing additional power to a connected load is disclosed. The system includes a power supply unit and an energy storage unit coupled to the power supply unit. A switch has an input coupled to the power supply unit. A power output provides power to the connected load. The power output is coupled to an output of the switch and the energy storage unit. A controller is operative to provide a charging period where the switch is turned on to provide power to the power output. The controller provides a boost period where the switch is controlled via a pulse width modulation signal to connect the power supply with the energy storage unit to supply power to the load when the switch is on, and with the energy storage unit to supply power to the load when the switch is off.
