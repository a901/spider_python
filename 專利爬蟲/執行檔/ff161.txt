EP3258758A1 (B1) • 2017-12-20 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2016-06-15 • Earliest publication: 2017-07-04
Disclosed is a component carrier including a chassis, a first component sled engaged with and receivable into the chassis, a fan module mounted at the front of the first component sled, and a second component sled engaged with and receivable into the chassis above the first component sled and rearward of the fan module. The first and second component sled are each transitionable between an extended position and a withdrawn position. The extended position has the respective component sled at least partially outside of the chassis and the withdrawn position has the respective component sled substantially received into the chassis. Transition of the first component sled from the withdrawn position to the extended position moves the fan module from the chassis but does not move the second component sled, while transition of the second component sled from the withdrawn position to the extended position moves the first component sled to the extended position.
