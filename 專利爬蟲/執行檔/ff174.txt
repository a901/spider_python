SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY UPDATING BIOS SETUP OPTIONS
EP3367636A1 (B1) • 2018-08-29 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2017-02-24 • Earliest publication: 2018-05-21
The present disclosure provides a system and method for enabling an administrator or a controller to update BIOS setup options on a server system and then automatically update the BIOS setup options on other server systems in a baseboard management controller (BMC) virtual local area network (VLAN). For example, the method may comprise: receiving, at a specific controller of a node, a command to update the BIOS setup option; determining whether the specific controller is a master by checking an internal flag of the specific controller; in an event that the specific controller is neither a master or a slave, broadcasting a master request to the VLAN; determining whether a reply is received within a predetermined time period; in an event that the reply is not received, setting the internal flag of the specific controller as a master; and sending an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) completion response.
