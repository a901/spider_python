A battery device (100) includes at least a battery cell, a management chip (121) and a bus (SMBus). The management chip is coupled to the battery cell and configured to detect a voltage or a remaining capacity of the battery cell and manage an operation state of the battery device according to the voltage or the remaining capacity of the battery cell. The bus is coupled to the management chip. The management chip is configured to communicate with a host device via the bus. The management chip is further configured to determine whether the remaining capacity of the battery cell is not increasing while in a charging state. When the remaining capacity of the battery cell is not increasing while in the charging state, the management chip is configured to activate a protection mechanism to make the battery device exit the charging state.
