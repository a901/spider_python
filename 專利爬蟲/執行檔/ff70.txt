The present disclosure provides a system and method for providing a basic power to a system in an event that a standby power of power supply units (PSUs) of the system fails. The system comprises a plurality of active components, one or more PSUs, and a power switch. The power switch is connected to a standby power output and a main power output of the PSUs. The power switch can receive status information of the PSUs and determine whether the main power of the PSUs is within a predetermined range. In an event that the standby power of the PSUs fails and the main power of the PSUs is within the predetermined range, the power switch can switch an input power from the standby power to the main power of the PSUs and output a basic power for system use.
