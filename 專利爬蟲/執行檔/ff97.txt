Systems and method for automatically composing resources with redundant fabric switches to support dual path HA storage access operation in a data center are provided. A data management module can be used to determine one or more drives in the data center that are connected to fabric switches. The fabric switches have a same chassis ID. The data management module can then associate the one or more drives to a first computer system via one fabric switch of the fabric switches, and associate the one or more to a second computer system via the other one fabric switch of the two fabric switches. In response to receiving a request from a specific user, the data management module can compose suitable resources of the data center to match the request based at least upon the one or more drives, the two switches, the first computer system, and the second computer system.
