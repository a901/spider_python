Earliest priority: 2017-02-23 • Earliest publication: 2018-08-23
A control circuit for managing a power supply unit (PSU) of a system board, routes a standby power port of the system board to a standby power port of the PSU. The control circuit monitors at least one electrical parameter for the standby power port of the system board by using a sensor, and determines that the at least one electrical parameter meets a criteria. The control circuit transmits an enable signal configured for enabling a main power port of the PSU coupled a the main power port of the system board and rerouting the standby power port of the system board to the main power port of the PSU, in response to determining that the at least one electrical parameter meets the criteria.
