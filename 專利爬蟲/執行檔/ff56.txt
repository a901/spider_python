The present invention provides a method for a local area network router (38), that allows communication between a number of remotely located users (10), and a plurality of peripheral devices (44-58) connected to the local area network router (38). Users may access the local area network using wireless devices or the Internet (42). The peripheral devices, which may include a wide variety of multi-media storage, playback, printing, or other functions, are connected to the router via local interfaces, which communicate with the peripheral devices via established protocols. Each of the peripheral devices (44-58) is provided with an IP address (86), which facilitates direct communication of the users (10) with the peripheral devices and permits direct communication with the devices over the Internet (42). Data packets destined for the IP address (86) of a peripheral device (78-84) are routed through the local interface (68-74), which converts the data utilizing compatible communication protocols for the target peripheral device (78-84).
