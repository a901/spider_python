A high speed circuit and a method for fabricating the same is disclosed. The high speed circuit has a printed circuit board. A pair of first and second differential traces are formed on a first surface of the printed circuit board. The differential traces carry an electrical signal. A partial loop extends through the printed circuit board. The partial loop includes first and second end slots under the first and second differential traces. The partial loop includes a pair of side slots substantially parallel to the differential traces. An anchor member connects the printed circuit board to an island formed by the first and second end slots and side slots, and forms a gap in one of the end slots or side slots. The length of the side slots and the length of the gap are selected to reduce a target common mode frequency from the electrical signal.
