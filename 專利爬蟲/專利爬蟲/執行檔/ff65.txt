An apparatus may include a chassis that can receive a sled and a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism can mechanically lock the sled to the chassis to prevent a sudden power loss that can be caused from an unexpected removal of the sled from the chassis. To avoid a sudden power loss, a voltage-sensing electrical switch lock can be implemented to the chassis to mechanically lock the sled to the chassis until the sled is ready to be removed. The sled may include one or more computing devices that need to be inactive before removing the sled. The apparatus includes a controller that may detect whether at least one of computing devices in the sled are in an active state or in an inactive state. Based on the determination of the state of the computing devices in the sled, the controller may activate the locking mechanism or de-active locking mechanism.
