OUT-OF-BAND RETRIEVAL OF NETWORK INTERFACE CONTROLLER INFORMATION
EP2977889A1 (B1) • 2016-01-27 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2014-07-22 • Earliest publication: 2016-01-27
In some implementations, network interface controller (NIC) configuration information can be obtained from a NIC prior to booting up an operating system. For example, a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) can obtain the NIC configuration information from the NIC during the execution of a system check (e.g., Power-On Self-Test). A system controller can receive the NIC configuration information from the BIOS. The system controller can store the NIC configuration information in memory associated with the system controller. A management system can request the NIC configuration information from the system controller using an out-of-band communication channel. For example, the management system can send the request for NIC configuration information to the system controller prior to powering on a server using a dedicated network interface of the system controller.
