A server rack is pre-loaded with servers, prior to the server rack being transported to a data center. In order to facilitate movement of the pre-loaded servers and server rack into the data center, dampers are provided on the underside of the server rack. The dampers absorb vibration as the server rack and servers are moved to, or within, the data center on transporting pallets.
