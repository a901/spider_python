Earliest priority: 2016-05-06 • Earliest publication: 2017-11-08
A method for power management by a rack management controller (RMC) of a server rack includes collecting power consumption data from a first baseboard management controller (BMC) of a first server in the server rack and sending the power consumption data to a management server. The RMC receives power requirements from the management server and determines a power setting based on the power consumption data and the power requirements. The RMC requests the first BMC to limit power consumption of the first server according to the power setting.
