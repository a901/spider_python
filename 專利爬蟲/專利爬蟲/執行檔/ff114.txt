A method and system to automatically configure a port on an Ethernet switch is disclosed. An Ethernet switch including a port connectable to a node is provided. A system node is coupled to the port of the Ethernet switch. The node sends a discovery packet to the Ethernet switch. The discovery packet includes role identity information of the node. The Ethernet switch determines whether the role identity information is matched with a role identification. The Ethernet switch configures the port from configuration data associated with the role identification.
