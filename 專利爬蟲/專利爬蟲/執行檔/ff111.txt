Systems and methods are provided for thermally managing a computer component which is untethered to a management controller. An exemplary method can comprise obtaining monitoring information for one or more untethered, thermally sensitive components of the computing device. The monitoring information can comprise temperature. The method can then provide for transmitting, via an OS, the monitoring information to the management controller via a system interface of the management controller. The method finally provides for adjusting, via the management controller, operation of at least one thermal management component which is tethered to the management controller.
