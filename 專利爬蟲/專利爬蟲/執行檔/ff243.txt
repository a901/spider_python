Earliest priority: 2016-12-21 • Earliest publication: 2018-01-21
The present disclosure provides a system and method for automatically updating firmware of components of a server system. For example, the method may include: downloading OS image file from a vendor, mounting downloaded OS image file to the server system via a virtual media (VM) A, automatically generating a universal serial bus (USB) read/write image containing a firmware image for VM B use, mounting the USB read/write image to a VM B, sending a command to a controller of the server system to set a boot disk via the VM A, rebooting the server system, and enabling an update service to automatically mount updated firmware image to the VM B.
