An information collection method for an injection pen includes several steps as follows. The action of the pressing knob is sensed to determine whether the rotation information of the pressing knob is obtained. The traveling movement of the injection pen is sensed to determine whether the movement information of the injection pen is obtained. A determination is made that the traveling movement of the injection pen is conformed as an intending injection action according to the rotation information of the pressing knob and the movement information of the injection pen. When the traveling movement of the injection pen is conformed as the intending injection action, an actual injection dose that the injection content is pushed outwards from the injection pen is calculated according to the rotation information of the pressing knob. The actual injection dose is recorded.
