HORIZONTAL COUPLING OF VERTICALLY-ORIENTED HARD DRIVE
EP2983061A1 (B1) • 2016-02-10 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2014-08-05 • Earliest publication: 2015-12-11
An apparatus adapted to house a component oriented in a first direction used for facilitating insertion and removal of the component in a second direction to/from a chassis, the first direction orthogonal to the second direction. The apparatus can be a caddy with an attached pivoting handle. Pivoting the handle in the first direction down towards the caddy causes the hard drive to slide in the second direction to couple with a hard drive coupling on the chassis. In some implementations, the caddy houses a hard drive in a vertical orientation, such that multiple hard drives can be coupled side-by-side to each other. In some implementations, the caddy is removably attached to the chassis. The chassis can comprise a rail, and the handle can comprise a hook. The hook attaches to the rail forming a removable attachment that allows for easy removal and insertion of the caddy.
