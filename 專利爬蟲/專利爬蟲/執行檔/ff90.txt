The present disclosure is directed to a system for providing substantially 180 degrees, or more, of rotation between a sheet metal door mounted on a sheet metal sidewall of a chassis, relative to the chassis. The system includes a first and a second shaft passing through a module positioned between the door and the sidewall, whereby the door rotates about the two shafts, where the two shafts are not axially aligned. The chassis may hold sleds of a server, and the door may further comprise multiple linking modules, such that the sleds are coupled to the linking modules when the door is in a closed position, and the sleds are slid home within the chassis.
