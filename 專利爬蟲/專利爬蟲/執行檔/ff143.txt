Earliest priority: 2016-04-01 • Earliest publication: 2017-06-21
Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for smart power clamping of a redundant power supply. A system configured according to this disclosure can measure, at a baseboard management controller, a system power consumption which indicates total power being delivered by a first power supply unit and a second power supply unit. The system can determine that the system power consumption exceeds a system power consumption capacity and, in response to the determination, communicate a power clamping signal to a processor, resulting in a reduced system power consumption. The system can further identify that the reduced system power consumption exceeds the system power consumption capacity and initiate a hardware throttling of at least one of the first power supply unit and the second power supply unit.
