A system having a rack, an input manifold, an output manifold, and a drain manifold is installed. The rack is configured to support a computing device. The input manifold, the output manifold, and the drain manifold are each configured to be fluidly coupled to the housing. When the computing device is in a first position relative to the rack, the input manifold and the output manifold are fluidly coupled to the housing and the drain manifold is disconnected from the housing. When the computing device is in a second position relative to the rack, the input manifold and the output manifold are disconnected from the housing and the drain manifold is fluidly coupled to the housing. When the computing device is in a third position relative to the rack, the input manifold, the output manifold, and the drain manifold are disconnected from the housing.
