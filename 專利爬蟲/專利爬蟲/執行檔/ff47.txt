Systems and methods are provided for controlling two or more PSUs of a server system. An exemplary method comprises first determining whether the PSUs are switched on to an AC power source. If the PSUs are found not switched on to an AC power source, the method further comprises restarting the AC power source for the PSUs and completing a software-based recovery process. If the PSUs are found to be switched on to an AC power source, the method further comprises determining whether the PSUs meet a predefined criterion. If the PSUs do meet a predefined criterion, the method further comprises disabling a cold-redundancy mode for the PSUs. If the PSUs do not meet a predefined criterion, the method further comprises starting a wake-up process for a first PSU from a cold-redundancy mode.
