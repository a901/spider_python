An insulin-dosage detection device is arranged on a rotation member of an insulin injection pen having an injection button. The rotation variation of the rotation member corresponds to the injection dosage of the insulin injection pen. The insulin-dosage detection device has a circuit, a detection button, and a processor. The circuit, arranged on the rotation member of the insulin injection pen, is configured to output electronic signals in response to rotation of the rotation member. The detection button is connected to the injection button. The rotation member of the insulin injection pen rotates in response to the detection button and the injection button being pressed. The circuit rotates along with the rotation member. The processor, coupled to the circuit, calculates the rotation variation of the rotation member according to a first electronic signal and a second electronic signal respectively output from the circuit before and after the rotation of the circuit.
