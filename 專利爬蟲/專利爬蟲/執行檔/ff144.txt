The fixing element is operable to fix the outer frame and the cooling fan. The light guide assembly includes a light guide post, a first stopping portion, and a second stopping portion. The light guide post penetrates through the cooling fan and the outer frame. The first stopping portion is located on the light guide post, and abuts against one surface of the cooling fan opposite to the outer frame. The second stopping portion is arranged opposite to the first stopping portion, is light-transmittable, and is optically coupled to the light guide post, and abuts against one surface of the outer frame opposite to the cooling fan.
