The present disclosure provides a system and method for dynamically optimizing an operation frequency of a server system to minimize booting time on the system. An exemplary system may comprise a frequency adjustment module, at least one internal sensor, at least one external sensor, one or more cooling components, a processor, a memory and a basic input/output system (BIOS). The frequency adjustment module can collect sensor data from the at least one internal sensor and/or the at least one external sensor. Based upon the sensor data and a thermal-frequency level table, the frequency adjustment module can determine a suitable operation frequency level for the server system to minimize booting time on the server system.
