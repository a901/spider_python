A connector panel allowing the use of different connector ports in proximity to each other is disclosed. The connector panel has a first type of connector port, such as an optical connector port. An articulated assembly is located adjacent the first type of connector port, and includes a second type of connector port. The articulated assembly may be swung out from the connector panel, thereby allowing for a connector to be inserted or removed from the second type of connector port without interference from the first type of connector port.
