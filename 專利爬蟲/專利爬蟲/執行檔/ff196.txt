EP3505771A1 (B1) • 2019-07-03 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2017-12-29 • Earliest publication: 2019-07-03
A cooling fan assembly is provided which includes a fan housing and an axial fan. The fan housing has a shroud panel with cutout portions along the airflow path of the axial fan. Fixed members separate the cutout portions. Flap members are attached to the fixed members so that the flap members can pivot between an open position and a closed position. The flap members are pushed by airflow from the axial fan into an open position when the fan is operational. When the fan is non-operational or when air begins to enter the fan in the reverse direction of the axial fan's airflow path, the flap members are configured to move to a closed position. In the closed position, air cannot flow through the reverse direction of the axial fan's airflow path.
