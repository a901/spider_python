An earthquake protective server rack is provided including an upper server rack frame to house a server and a lower server rack frame. The lower server rack frame combines linear modules that dissipate earthquake energy along the X- and Y-axes and a dampening module that dissipates earthquake energy along a Z-axis. Mechanical movement of the feet on the lower server rack frame permits movement of the protective sever rack on rollers or alternatively to permit full function of the earthquake energy absorbing function while supported by the feet.
