A component carrier includes a tray, a slide cage, a level and a tilting mechanism. The tray has a bottom surface with a groove formed therein. The slide cage is actuatably coupled with the tray and has a receiving space and an undercarriage. The lever is pivotally coupled with the slide cage and has a lower portion for engaging the groove to transition the slide cage between a first position and a second position. The tilting mechanism is coupled with the tray and configured for biasing the slide cage to the second position. In the first position the undercarriage of the slide cage is positioned proximal to the bottom surface of the tray. In the second position a first end portion of the undercarriage of the slide cage is displaced away from the bottom surface and a second end portion is positioned proximal to the bottom surface of the tray.
