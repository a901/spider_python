EP3637224A1 (B1) • 2020-04-15 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2018-10-09 • Earliest publication: 2020-02-11
A system and method for compensating for voltage drops in a device having a remote node (606) is disclosed. A power supply unit (602) has an adjustable voltage output and a feedback circuit (630). A power path (604) is coupled to the power supply unit to supply voltage to the remote node. A switch (624) has an output (626) coupled to the feedback circuit, a first input coupled to the power path (604), and a second input coupled to the remote node (606). A controller is coupled to the switch. The controller is operable to control the switch to switch between the inputs to cause the feedback circuit of the power supply unit to compensate the voltage output for a voltage drop on the power path or the remote node.
