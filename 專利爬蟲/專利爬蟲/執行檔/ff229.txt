The present invention provides a device for controlling the time period required to remove a server from a slot. The time period is sufficient for data to be saved from the server prior to power being shut off to the server and its removal from the slot. The device has an arm with a proximal end and a distal end. The arm is mounted for rotation about a first axis from a closed position to an open position. A mechanism applies a motive force to the arm to bias the arm to the open position.
