An apparatus for cooling an electronic component is provided. The apparatus includes a heat-absorbing base configured to contact the electronic component within a server device and a heat-dissipating body connected to the heat-absorbing base. The heat-dissipating body includes a heat-dissipating static feature and at least one heat-dissipating dynamic feature. The at least one heat-dissipating dynamic feature is configured to be repositioned about the heat-dissipating static feature to increase a surface area of the heat-dissipating body. Using hinge device and flexible metal conduit connect and transfer heat to them (dynamic and static feature). This apparatus will follow currently assembly process and also not impact the other device assembly method. The more space we have inside the product the more heat we can solve.
