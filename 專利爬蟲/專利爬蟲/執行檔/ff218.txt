A state-detection device, adapted in a host, includes a battery, a gas gauge, a processor, and a display. The battery is operating in an operation state. The gas gauge is configured to instantly detect the operation state and stores state information of the battery in a plurality of registers. The processor determines, according to the state information, whether the battery is operating in a normal state, a temporary failure state, or a permanent failure state to generate state-determination information. When the battery is operating in the temporary failure state, the processor further determines whether the temporary failure state is an over-temperature state, an over-voltage state, or an over-current state according to a first value, a second value, and a third value, respectively, of the state information. The display is configured to display the state-determination information.
