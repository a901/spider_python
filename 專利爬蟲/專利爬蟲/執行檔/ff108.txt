The present disclosure describes devices and methods that allow for authenticating a firmware settings input file. The devices and methods of the present disclosure provide for receiving a firmware settings input file and a code associated with the firmware settings input file. The firmware settings input file is configured for updating firmware settings within the computer system. The devices and methods further generate a first value based on the firmware settings input file, and decrypt the code with an encryption key to obtain a second value from the code. The devices and methods further compare the first value and the second value to authenticate the firmware settings input file based on whether the first value and second values satisfy one or more conditions. When the conditions are satisfied, the firmware within the computer system can be updated based on the firmware settings input file.
