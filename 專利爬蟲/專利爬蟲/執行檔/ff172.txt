An apparatus includes a fan module and an elongated lens. The fan module includes a housing and a cover plate having a plurality of apertures. The elongated lens includes a head portion that extends through one of the apertures of the cover plate. The head portion has a first dimension and a second dimension. The aperture also has a first dimension and a second dimension. The first dimension of the head portion is less than the first dimension of the aperture and is greater than the second dimension of the aperture. When the first dimension of the head portion is aligned with the first dimension of the aperture, the aperture permits the head portion to pass through the aperture. When the first dimension of the head portion is aligned with the second dimension of the aperture, the aperture prevents the head portion from passing through the aperture.
