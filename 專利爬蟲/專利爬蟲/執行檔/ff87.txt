Systems, methods, and computer-readable media for managing nodes through virtual rack management modules. A system can have a first rack that includes a first top-of-rack (ToR) switch and a first group of nodes. The first ToR switch can be connected to the first group of nodes. The system can also have a second rack that includes a second ToR switch and a second group of nodes. The second ToR switch can be connected to the second group of nodes, and the second ToR switch can be connected to the first ToR switch. Furthermore, the system can include a rack management node that executes a hypervisor. The hypervisor can run a first virtual rack management module (vRMM) and a second vRMM. The first vRMM and the second vRMM can manage the first group of nodes and the second group of nodes, respectively.
