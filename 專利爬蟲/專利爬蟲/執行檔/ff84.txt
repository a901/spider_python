This disclosure relates to a structure that conveniently and easily releases computer components from a supporting structure. A typical computer component would be a PCIe card within a GPU tray. The disclosed structure does not require the use of tools to release computer components, and can be used where computer components ordinarily cannot be released due to limitations of space. The structure lifts the computer component to a height where the computer component can be easily grasped by human fingers for removal of the component.
