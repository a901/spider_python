Various examples of the present technology provide systems and methods for monitoring an AC power to a computing system, generating a power failure signal when the AC power is determined abnormal, and cause one or more components of the computing system to be switched to a low power mode or shut down to reduce power consumption of the computing system. In particular, the various embodiments of the present technology provide a method to extend hold time of a power supply unit (PSU), thus extend power-on time of a server system during an input power interruption.
