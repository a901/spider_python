WARM SWAPPING OF HARDWARE COMPONENTS WITH COMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION
EP3211532A1 (B1) • 2017-08-30 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2016-02-24 • Earliest publication: 2017-06-21
Systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for hardware recovery are disclosed. In some examples, a system can detect a hardware error and identify a system component associated with the hardware error. The system can then generate a request configured to trigger an operating system of the system to place the system in a particular operating state. The particular operating state can be determined based on a component type of the system component. The particular operating state can be a first sleep state when the component type is a peripheral component or a second sleep state when the component type is a processor, a memory, or a power supply. The second sleep state can result in a lower power resource consumption than the first sleep state. The system can generate an indication that the system component can be replaced without restarting the operating system.
