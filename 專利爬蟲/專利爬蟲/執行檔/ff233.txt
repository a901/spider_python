A high speed differential trace structure is disclosed. The differential trace structure includes a first trace 210 and a parallel second trace 212. A printed circuit board layer 202 has a top surface 204 and an opposite bottom surface 206. The traces 210, 212 are formed on the top surface 204. The structure includes a ground plane layer 208 having a top surface 220 in contact with the opposite bottom surface 206 of the circuit board. A first void section 224 is formed in the ground plane layer to one side of the first trace 210. A second void section 226 is formed in the ground plane layer to one side of the second trace 212. The length of the second void section is determined based on a target radiation frequency. A third void section 228 is formed in the ground plane layer that joins the first void section and the second void section.
