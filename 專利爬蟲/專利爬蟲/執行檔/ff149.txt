A smart battery device includes a battery unit, a temperature-sensing unit and a processing unit. The temperature-sensing unit senses the ambient temperature to generate a temperature signal. The processing unit is coupled to the battery unit and the temperature-sensing unit. In a charging mode, the processing unit receives the temperature signal and obtains the power capacity of the battery unit. The processing unit sets full capacity according to the temperature signal and generates an indication flag when the power capacity of the battery unit reaches the full capacity, wherein the indication flag is used to indicate that the battery unit is in a fully charged state.
