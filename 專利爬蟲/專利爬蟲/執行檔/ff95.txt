The present technology provides a system and method for selectively powering down active component(s) of a system based upon PSU status and power demand of the system. The present technology enables the system in operation as long as the system has at least one operative PSU. The system comprises a plurality of active components, two or more PSUs, a management device and a hardware device. The hardware device can receive status information of the two or more PSUs and system power demand information. In response to determining that the power capacity of the two or more PSUs is less than the power demand of the system, the hardware device can determine status of the PSUs. In response to determining that the status of at least one PSU is not ok, the hardware device can turn off at least one of the plurality of active components based upon a power-down sequence.
