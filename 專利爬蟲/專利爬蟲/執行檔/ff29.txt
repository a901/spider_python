The present disclosure provides a system and method for resetting a hang-up baseboard management controller (BMC), or another component of a server system using a hardware watch-dog-timer (HW WDT) circuit and/or complex programmable logic device (CPLD). The HW WDT circuit can monitor heartbeat signals from the BMC, and determine the health condition of the BMC. In an event that the BMC's health condition fails to meet a predefined criterion, the HW WDT circuit generates a reset signal to reset the BMC. The CPLD can collect from the BMC, health information of components of the server system. The CPLD can also collect the BMC's health condition from the HW WDT circuit. Upon determining which specific component of the server system hangs up, the CPLD can generate a reset signal to reset the specific component.
