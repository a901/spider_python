A system and method for distributing tasks between computing devices in a rack. Each of the computing devices have hardware resources and is coupled to a management network. A rack management controller monitors the utilization of hardware resources by each of the computing devices. The rack management controller allocates performance of tasks, such as operating virtual machines, to some of the computing devices to maximize computing devices with substantially full hardware resource utilization. The rack management controller minimizes the allocation of tasks to computing devices with less than full hardware resource utilization. The rack management controller commands any idle computing devices to minimize power consumption.
