Systems and methods are provided for determining whether an optical cable matches a port on a switch device. The present disclosure can provide for a switch device which includes a cable identification tool. The cable identification tool can be configured to receive a port configuration table from a management device. The switch device can then obtain features of at least one cable attached to a port of the switch device. The switch device can then compare the obtained features with a table entry in the port configuration table to yield a comparison result. The table entry can correspond to the port to which the at least one cable is attached. Based on the comparison result, the switch device can generate one or more notifications. The notifications can indicate a match status of the at least one cable to the port.
