A dynamic air impedance mechanism is provided which has particular utility in changing the impedance of air flow within servers. The mechanism comprises an air duct having a plurality of vent holes, a control plate defining a plurality of openings, and a fan to draw air through the vent holes in the air duct. Relative movement between the openings in the control plate and the corresponding vent holes in the air duct changes the impedance.
