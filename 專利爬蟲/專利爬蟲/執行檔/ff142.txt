Various examples of the present technology provide a cluster-architecture to support a scalable pooled-NVMe storage box that can be shared among a scalable number of nodes. The scalable pooled-NVMe storage box comprises NVMe drives, one or more switches and one or more switch ports. The number of NVMe drives in the scalable scalablepooled-NVMe storage box can be scaled up or down based upon a number of nodes that need to share the scalable pooled-NVMe storage box.
