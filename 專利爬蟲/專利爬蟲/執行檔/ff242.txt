SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VOLTAGE REGULATOR SELF-BURN-IN TEST
EP3410133A1 (B1) • 2018-12-05 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2017-05-31 • Earliest publication: 2018-12-05
The present disclosure provides a system and method enabling a self-burn-in test for a power supply device (PSD) of a server system using a multi-phase scheme. The PSD comprises a power-width modulation (PWM) controller, and a plurality of power stages. Each of the plurality of power stages comprises a driver, a high-side MOSFET, and a low-side MOSFET. In one aspect of the present disclosure, upon receiving a test mode command from a controller of the server system, the PWM controller can send a PWM signal to switch a specific power stage to the On state, and send at least another PWM signal that switches other power stage(s) of the plurality of power stages to the Tri-state. During a subsequent self-burn-in test of the specific power stage, low-side MOSFET(s) of the other power stage(s) can function as a load for the specific power stage.
