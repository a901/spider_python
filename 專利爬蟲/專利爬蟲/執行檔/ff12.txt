A computing device includes a first component comprising a magnetic field sensor with a sensing region and a second component comprising a magnetic portion. The computing device also includes a controller communicatively coupled to the magnetic field sensor. In the computing device, the second component is movable between a first position relative to the first component, and one or more second positions relative to the first component, whereby the magnetic portion is positioned in the sensing region when the sensing portion is in the first position. The magnetic field sensor is configured for generating one or more first signals in response to detecting the magnetic portion within the sensing region. The controller is configured for generating a second signal in response to the first signals indicating the second component is in the first position.
