In some implementations, a system administrator can specify a maximum amount of power for a data center or a rack of servers. If the data center or rack consumes more than a threshold amount of power, the data center or rack can be put into power capping mode. Once in power capping mode, servers in the data center or rack can be power capped. The amount of power at which a server is capped can be dynamically determined based on the amount of discretionary power available to distribute among the power capped servers in the rack or data center and the amount of power that the server consumes relative to other servers in the data center or rack. Once power consumption in the data center or rack falls below a threshold level, power capping for the data center or rack can be disabled.
