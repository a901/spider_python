A system (100) and method for current balancing from a three-phase AC power source (102a, 102b,102c) is disclosed. The system (100) includes power supply units (112,114,116), each having inputs coupled to one output of the three phase power source (106a, 106b, 106c), and a neutral conductor (104). Multiple loads (130,132,134) are each coupled to a DC output of one of the power supply units (112,114,116). Each of the loads include a component having adjustable power consumption. A controller (126) is coupled to each of the power supply units (112,114,116) and each of the loads (130,132,134). The controller (126) is operable to compare the power consumption of each of the loads to an average value. The controller adjusts the power consumption of at least one of the loads to balance the power consumption between the loads.
