A protective device for a cable in the form of a plurality of interconnected links forming a chain. At least one of the links comprises a retaining element, which may be a C-shaped or an L-shaped element which completes the formation of an enclosed void into which a cable can be inserted for protection. Each link preferably incudes two opposed sidewalls connected by a bottom wall and the C-shaped or L-shaped element. When the retaining member is the L-shaped element, the L-shaped element is hingedly connected to one of the opposed sidewalls.
