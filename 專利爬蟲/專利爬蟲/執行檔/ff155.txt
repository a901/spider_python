A differential trace structure (10) reducing the magnitude of low frequency attenuation is disclosed. The trace structure (10) is formed on a printed circuit board. A pair of differential traces (12) connects a signal receiver (16) and a signal transmitter (14). A passive equalizer (150) has a first shunt (400) coupled to one of the pair of differential traces (12); and a second shunt (402) coupled to the other one of the pair of differential traces (12). The passive equalizer (150) has an inductor (412) and a resistor (410) coupled in series to the shunts. For low frequency signals, the passive equalizer (150) behaves as a shunt resistance to the pair of differential traces (12).
