PREVENTING DEVICE POWER ON AFTER UNRECOVERABLE ERROR
EP3016226A1 (B1) • 2016-05-04 • QUANTA COMP INC
Earliest priority: 2014-10-27 • Earliest publication: 2015-08-18
In some implementations, a system controller (104) of a computing device (100) can be configured to receive a power-on signal and prevent the computing device (100) from providing power to components of the computing device (100). In some implementations, upon receiving a power-on signal, the system controller (104) can retrieve fault data from a power supply unit (116). The fault data can be analyzed to determine whether the power supply unit detected an unrecoverable failure. When an unrecoverable failure is detected, the system controller (104) can prevent the power supply unit (116) from providing power to other components of the computing device (100). In some implementations, an unrecoverable failure can be detected when the fault data (118) indicates that an overcurrent, an overvoltage, or an over-temperature fault has occurred.
