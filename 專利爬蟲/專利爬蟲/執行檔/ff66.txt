A server includes a housing, a sled, a cable sleeve mounted to the sled, and an obstruction in the housing. The housing defines a sled channel and a cable channel. The sled can be inserted into the sled channel. A cable is positioned in the cable sleeve. The obstruction is aligned with the cable channel. Prior to the sled being inserted into the housing, the cable sleeve is in a first position aligned with the obstruction and the cable channel. As the sled is inserted into the housing, contact between the cable sleeve and the obstruction moves the cable sleeve to a second position. In the second position, the cable sleeve is not aligned with the obstruction. The cable sleeve is biased towards the first position. As the cable sleeve travels past the obstruction, the cable sleeve moves back to the first position.
