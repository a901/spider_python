A tooth-position recognition system includes an electronic device and a calculation device. The electronic device includes a first camera. The first camera is configured to capture a plurality of tooth images. The calculation device includes a second camera and a processor. The second camera is configured to capture a user image. The processor is configured to receive the tooth images, compare the corresponding position of each pixel in each tooth image to generate a depth map, and input the tooth images, the depth map, and a plurality of first tooth-region identifiers into a tooth deep-learning model. The tooth deep-learning model outputs a plurality of deep-learning probability values that are the same in number as the first tooth-region identifiers. The processor inputs the user image and the plurality of second tooth-region identifiers into a user-image deep-learning model.
