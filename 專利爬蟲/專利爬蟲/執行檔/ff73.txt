An exemplary computing device includes a motherboard structure, a first processor, a second processor, and a plurality of connectors disposed on the motherboard structure. The first processor and the second processor can each have at least three BPIPs. A first and second of BPIPs of the first processor can be connected to a first and second BPIPs of the second processor. A third BPIP of the first processor and a third BPIP of the second processor can be connected to a first one and a second one of the plurality of connectors. The plurality of connectors can be connected to a computing card. In some examples, the computing device includes a switching element to selectively couple the connectors to any other element in the computing device.
