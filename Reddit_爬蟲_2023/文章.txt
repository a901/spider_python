"Laos probably isn't a central point from where your ancestors spread out but it would make sense that you'd have a lot of Laos DNA relatives if you score mostly Chinese Dai. The available archaelogical, genetic, and linguistic evidence suggests that there was a historic migration of Tai-Kradai speaking people from present-day Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China into present-day Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. \"Chinese Dai\" is a Tai-Kradai speaking group. The Chinese people of the South China Sea coast and Vietnamese people also have a lot of Tai-Kradai ancestry.","

"This is just taxonomy so you can create whatever categories you find useful, 23andMe apparently went with 2 categories but essentially most Chinese people can be described as a simple mix between Iron Age North Chinese(from the Yellow river Valley) and southern Sinitic Natives(mostly like modern or late Han era Kra-Dai/Zhuang(?) speakers in Guangxi and Guizhou, Taiwanese natives(Austronesian) and possibly Bronze Age Vietnam).

I imagine \"North Chinese\" in 23andMe roughly corresponds to a 80-100% Iron age North Chinese and a 0-20% southern native mix(during the 2.2 thousand years of Chinese rule over the south people from the Yangtze migrated north at times and brought some of their assimilated southern ancestry with them).

Southern Chinese in 23andMe should be something like 40-60% Iron Age North Chinese and 40-60% southern native mix if I recall the correct numbers.","

"It is more conventional to call Fujian and sometimes by extension Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu as Southeast China 东南沿海地区. Guangdong is usually quoted on its own or with Guangxi as deep south 两广地区.   


Here by southeast Chinese I meant the Chinese from Fujian, Zhejiang and their derived diaspora in Taiwan, Southeast Asia etc.   


I agree with the rest except personally, I think matching modern populations directly with ancient ethnicities quoted in historical literature is not a rigorous approach historiography-wise. That is, we cannot guarantee the reliability of those primary sources. We can only unravel \"the truth\" (I'm very reluctant to use this as even the truth could be under subjective interpretation) through DNA analysis. Under the current situation, ancient DNA from South China is scarce so we do not know what kind of people inhabited that area at different periods yet. It's a bit too soon to jump to conclusions.    


Still, thanks for the collection of lovely Guangdong results.","

"You observations aren’t that far fetched. Even hokkiens from Taiwan/fujian can sometime look Malay (but it’s not the norm). This may be because of some admixture with indigenous minyue people. But hokkiens on average group closer to central Chinese compared to other southern Han subgroups. It’s usually Cantonese - hakka- teochew/hokkien in that order from most to least southern shifted. 

As for the southern people identifying as Han, it’s kinda like what you said. In the past, southern Chinese weren’t considered “Han” until post Qing dynasty to which all Chinese were labeled as Han for unification purposes. Original Han people were those who lived around the yellow river (northern china).

Southern Chinese people are usually mixed as their paternal ancestry is quite similar to those from the northern plains but their maternal lineage is where things differ a bit.

I read somewhere in the past that hokkien had paternal lineage (at 95%) most similar to those of the northern plains among southern groups consisting of people from guangxi, fujian, and guangdong. Teochew should be around the same. 

But at the end of the day, the ethnic group Han-Chinese isn’t really a genetic marker but rather an indicator of cultural identification.","

"Northern Han do have a bit of shared autosomal DNA with more northern nomadic groups (e.g. my wife scores 6.2% Amur river hunter gatherer) but it's more likely from the pre-historic Neolithic times rather than from the historical period. Also, if you look at the autosomal DNA of modern day ethnic Mongolians from Inner Mongolia, their autosomal DNA is more Northern Han shifted than Outer Mongolians so the main direction of historic genetic flow was actually in the opposite direction of what you might think.

As for Y-DNA lineages, the common C-M217 Y-DNA haplogroup lineages of the ancient Xianbei/Rouran/Donghu/Shiwei/Mongol/Jurchen/Manchu are very rare in Northern Han today, despite the many nomad established dynasties in Northern China throughout history. There are two main subclades of C-M217, one which is the \"Northern\" one (called C2a in current nomenclature) that contains most of the C-M217 lineages common in northern Asian nomads. The other main subclade is the \"Southern\" one (called C2b in current nomenclature) that most likely expanded somewhere in Northern China during the Neolithic that contains most of the C-M217 lineages common in East Asia (China/Korea/Japan/Vietnam). The TMRCA of the \"Northern\" and \"Southern\" C2 subclades is way before the historical period, even way before the Neolithic so they don't have as much in common as you think.

The \"Southern\" C2b subclade is what my Y-DNA haplogroup belongs to. C-M217 as a whole does show a North-South cline in China, being about 2x more common in the Northern China versus Southern China. There's some good posts here that outline the Y-DNA frequencies from 23mofang: https://anthrogenica.com/showthread.php?23896-The-deep-population-history-of-northern-East-Asia-from-the-Late-Pleistocene-to-the/page20

Since you are Hakka/Teochew, on G25 I'd guess you would score ~70% Neolithic Yellow River Farmer and ~30% Southeast Asian Neolithic Farmer. I would guess that Cantonese get ~60% Neolithic Yellow River Farmer and ~40% Southeast Asian Neolithic Farmer but they also have more genetic variability than every other Han Chinese sub-group so there would be some Cantonese that score closer to Southern Min groups and others that score closer to Daic minorities from Guangxi.","

Yo, that's pretty wild, though, with regards to your G25 results. Have you tried deleting the Han samples with significant southern admixture (ie, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, most of the Jiangsu samples, Hubei) from your calculator spreadsheet? You might get more interesting results that way. Those southern Han samples absorb a lot of interesting ancestry.","

Basically, there were 3 diverse populations inhabiting the provinces of Guangxi, Fujian and greater SEA in the initial Holocene. These ancestral groups begin to mix as is seen in the *Dushan*(Qihe-related) and *Baojianshan*(Hòabìnhian-related) people who lived in Guangxi up until ~4000 BC.

Then rice agriculture starts heating up and waves of Northern people start gradually migrating into SEA/Taiwan/Philippines, pretty much solidifying the current-day populations in these regions *except* for ethnic Dai and Hmong-Mien people. The dna of Chinese Dai shows a strong affinity to Guangxi people from ~1,500 y.a. while the Hmong-Mien are closer to those from ~500.

"You must be pretty southern-shifted, even for a Taishanese, since our results are [quite similar](https://imgur.com/a/LFMf7kI) and one of my grandparents was from Guangxi.

"&gt;what did you mean by south shifted Chinese?

South shifted Chinese would indicated Han Chinese people from more Southern or Eastern provinces, since both South and Eastern Han cluster closer to each other than they do with Northern Han. Both South and Eastern Han tend to have admixture that is more Southeast Asian leaning and less Siberian shifted than their Northern Han counterparts. North Han have higher East Asian and Siberian admixture than East and South Han.

South Han (genetically) can include anything from Southern, Southwestern, Eastern, Southeastern, to South Central provinces. Guangdong, Hainan, Henan, Hubei and Hunan, Guangxi Zhuang are considered South Central. I would consider Southeastern Chinese provinces Fujian, Hainan, and Guangdong. Eastern provinces include Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. SW China includes Tibet, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, and Yunnan. You get the idea. 

Since I am 3/4 Eastern Chinese (includes Han but with some minor Hui) and only 1/4 Northern Han, I would call myself (at least genetically) more South shifted than North shifted, although some other people prefer to call me North-shifted Eastern Chinese due to my quarter Shandong ancestry. Self-identification can go many ways haha.","

You are also right about many Thai people with some Chinese ancestry that no longer recognize themselves as Chinese. They would not be considered Thai Chinese in this case.

By chance, are you familiar with the Zhuang people in the Southern province of Guangxi in China? I know that a large amount of Tai people (Thai/Lao today) migrated from Guangxi as well.

"&gt; me is An Sinh, which is a town(?) whose Chinese name is 生安. I got the Chinese name looking at Google maps pictures of a Chinese temple there called 祠生安. However I don’t think this is the right place because the Cantonese pronunciation is off, as 生安 is “sang on”. It could just be a village with no official township). Her parents (my grandparents) moved to Sin On from Guangxi. The village, as I called it, is a Chinese village—the people there, or their ancestors, all hail from Southern China, speak Cantonese, identify as Chinese, etc. Fun fact: I was also told stories of how the Vietnamese from bordering villages would come and steal stuff and terrorize the village back in the day?!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway... LOL. My relatives on my mom’s side also ended up immigrating to the US, and I actually connected with my grandma’s half brother’s granddaughter (which makes her my half second cousin I believe), who I used to play with when I was little. Her mother was also born in Sin On. Her results are interesting, too: bot

Do you know if your family/villagers in Sin On spoke standard Cantonese or another Yue/Ping dialect? Yue speaking Han usually have a big chunk of Dai/Zhuang type ancestry already, and groups from Guangxi have even more with Ping speaking people apparently being sinicized Zhuang. Also 生 could be a lot closer to 'sin' depending on dialect but I'd say its probably a different character.","

"The “Han” has been viewed as both an ethnic but also as a cultural concept. If you adopted Han culture, you were integrated into the historical fabric that was China. Except for a couple of periods in Chinese history where imperial dynasties practiced conquest (but never on the scale undertaken by Europeans or the Mongols) and / or sent large expeditions overseas, the general preference was to draw foreigners into assimilation and have them realize the “superiority” of Han Chinese ways. However it would be a mistake to dismiss the Han as a genetic concept because although MtDNA is quite varied, the Han are still overwhelmingly O2 / O3 along the paternal line especially O3 which is sometimes believed to be the signature Y-haplogroup for the Han Chinese.

    My grandfather on my mom’s side is actually from Xi’An in the northwest but I feel no connection to the northwestern branch and consider myself fully southern by heritage. Actually it’s not unusual at all because Sichuanese / Chongqingnese are in essence a mix of Chinese from different provinces who migrated and settled in Sichuan / Chongqing over the centuries. These days you’d be hard pressed to find someone in Sichuan or Chongqing whose ancestors have been there for say, over 10 generations. In the early years of the Qing, the region was ravaged by war. To revitalize agriculture and the economy, the Qing court sent migrants from other provinces to settle there, sometimes using forced evictions from their ancestral homes. 

    The bulk of these migrants were from Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi but there were also migrants from Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi etc. In Chongqing these different groups of Chinese set up their own cliques in the form of guild houses but only the one for Cantonese migrants has been preserved.","

"Fair, but I think your general premise only works if you broadly define everything Shanghai and southward as \"Southern China.\" Among core Southern Han populations (based on PRC regional definitions as well as historical geographical distinction), i.e. those located in Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, and Yunan, there usually is admixture/allele sharing with local non-Han populations and SEA. ~1% from this area, as is the case of OP, can definitely derive from a single grandparent (who, if extrapolating, would only need to be ~3% admixed in this way). I just don't see three Southern Han, and based on OP's response I'd assume that's right since at most two could be from Hubei (broadly speaking I'd consider this \"Central\" but you could qualify it as \"Southern,\" I suppose).","

"Hi there, seems like you received your results far earlier in advance than the stipulated date. You have a lot of Southeast Asian admixture which is expected for Cantonese speakers, but seems like your Southeast Asian (Vietnamese and Chinese Dai) % is on the higher end even for Cantonese speakers. You might have recent ancestry from the western part of Guangdong province instead, closer to the borders with Vietnam and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Very interesting trace ancestry as well, could have something to do with Guangzhou historically being a major port of call for trade and commerce.

Here's my results for comparison, as aforementioned my grandparents were from the eastern part of Guangdong and southern part of Fujian:

"Thanks for the link + info. Your results make sense, you are much more \"East Coast\" genetically than me. I think my dad's side of the family from Western Guangdong is probably pretty south genetically and could have a lot of \"minority\" DNA. As you mentioned it's almost in Guangxi and near Vietnam's north border. They definitely identified as Hakka though and not any other minority group.

Here is K47:

 [https://yourdnaportal.com/gadata/K47](https://yourdnaportal.com/gadata/K47) 

You have to sign in and then upload raw data.

My results for reference:

East Asian: 40.54%

South Chinese: 20.3%

Proto-Austronesian: 9.83%

Indo Chinese: 9.71%

Malay: 16.87%

Amuro-Manchurian: 1.81%

Mongolian: 1%

It matches closely with Cantonese samples I've seen floating around. From looking at other people's results, \"East Asian\" + \"South Chinese\" =60-70% for most Han Chinese, and these two components constitute the \"core\" of Han Chinese. The other parts (Mongolian/Manchurian/Malay/Austronesian/etc) show how North vs South you are.

It's weird because I'm technically \"mixed\" between 1/4 Sichuan and 3/4 Guangdong. I think Sichuanese people are slightly more North? And for me to come out being \"Cantonese\" genetically that must mean my father's side is much more south, possibly even mostly Lingnan-like DNA. Though I'm O3, so maybe they've just been in the south for many, many generations. I think a larger shock would come from me being O1 and implying that my family were indigenous to South China. That would take longer/harder to process lol. This deep ancestry analysis is starting to hurt my brain.

I tested my mom too, so we'll see how that changes my 23andme results.

As for your results on Wegene/23mofang, did you simply upload 23andme results or did you send in actual samples? I think they test samples a lot more in depth than 23andme.","

"You are right, it's better to take these autosomal DNA test numbers with a pinch of salt. Autosomal DNA tests which determine whatever % of an ethnicity you are can only be used as a gauge at best, but the results to tend to differ from company to company depending on the population database. Personally I've also had 23mofang tell me I'm 84.15% Southern Han, 15.85% Hmong and not Vietnamese at all. Ethnicity and race is more of a social construct similar to the idea of nationality, assimilation and naturalisation took place all the time over the course of the past thousands of years. Furthermore autosomal DNA tests are only useful for tracking recent ancestry in the past few hundred years and they are incapable of tracking anything further back in the past beyond that. As much as there's no such thing called \"pure Han\", the same can be said for any other ethnicity in the world. 

Anyway, the idea that Guangdong / Guangxi used to be Vietnamese territory is false, this idea actually arose due to nationalist rhetoric, inferiority complex after years of suppression of the Vietnamese at the behest of the Chinese and the French which has led to this fervent post-independence search for national identity and pride, even it if involved inventing some crazy creation myth. Similar events have occurred in Korea (Koreans claim that the Liaodong Peninsula in China was \"historical Korean territory\") and it is a very dangerous, insidious thought to have which Vietnamese and Korean nationalists are trying to spread to foreigners in order to change the historical narrative in the region. Japanese sources tend to be more level-headed and less biased in this aspect.

Guangdong and Guangxi never belonged to Vietnam. The term Hundred Yue aka Baiyue / Bach Viet (百越) was a catch-all term used to refer to many various tribes and ethnicities in Southern China prior to Sinicization, many of whom spoke different languages and were not related to each other. The Baiyue consisted mostly of Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien speaking tribes. It is still unknown whether any of the Yue tribes actually even spoke an Austro-Asiatic language (related to Vietnamese / Khmer) or an Austronesian language. During the Qin Dynasty, General Zhao Tuo (aka Trieu Da in Vietnamese) who btw was ethnic Han Chinese established the kingdom of Nanyue / Nam Viet (南越), with the capital located in Panyu (番禺), centered around modern day Guangzhou. The territory of Nanyue encompassed Guangdong, Guangxi and Northern Vietnam (at the time known as Giao Chi or Jiaozhi) and perhaps this was where the idea that \"the Vietnamese lived in Guangdong\" came from.

Prior to the establishment of the Nanyue kingdom, there is no evidence to suggest that the Vietnamese were active in the region of Guangdong. While eastern Guangdong was mainly inhabited by various Hmong-Mien speaking people like the She (畲族), western Guangdong and Guangxi were mainly populated by Tai-Kadai speakers like the Zhuang (壮族), not the Austro-Asiatic speaking Vietnamese who were centered around the Red River Delta area of North Vietnam.","

"Your results are almost identical to mine right down to the percentages!!: https://m.imgur.com/a/1z6QSxO

Is your family from Guangxi? My dad is from SW Guangdong so I’m not too surprised by my relatively high Dai and Vietnamese percentages. A lot of Han men married minority group women - I suspect my family married into the Zhuang minority but claim Han since it’s the dominant group.

As for the European, perhaps it can be distant Portuguese if your family is from the Macau area. My great-grandpa was from Macau, I didn’t score any European on 23andMe and Wegene but on quite a few GedMatch calculators (e.g Dodecad, all the Eurogenes) I got around 1.5% West Med/Atlantic so maybe I have a Portuguese ancestor somewhere from the 1600/1700s.","

"In 7:50 she said her ancestors came from central China to Guangxi and Guangdong area. There was no mention of GuangZhou. I know they live in Huizhou which is a Hakka city and I remembered that she's local, but maybe I was wrong and she moved to Huizhou. She did mentioned that one of her grandparents was Chaoshan too.

Honestly her family name is a popular one among Zhuang people...her ancestors might have been Zhuang. 

Btw I know a Wei from Huizhou and maybe they are from the same family? It's not a common family name in Hakka region...","
